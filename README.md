# HubHuman

Automatically create a `humans.txt` file based upon public members of a GitHub organization.

## Wut?

GitHub.com has a [shiny humans.txt](http://github.com/humans.txt) on their site which is [autogenerated from the organization team list](http://www.quora.com/GitHub/Does-GitHub-keep-its-complete-employee-list-in-the-sites-humans-txt-file/answer/Zach-Holman).  This is an nice way to keep the file up to date, so here's a quick hack to do so.

## Usage

Just pass the GitHub organization name. For example, the following commmand:

    ruby hubhuman.rb flickr

Would produce the following output:

    /* TEAM */

      Daniel Bogan (waferbaby)
      Site: http://usesthis.com/
      Location: San Francisco, California

      Eric Gelinas (standardpixel)
      Site: blog.standardpixel.com
      Location: San Francisco, California

      Stephen Woods (saw)
      Site: stephenwoods.net
      Location: 94110

    [...]

You may want to set up a cron task to periodically do the following to keep yours up to date:

    ruby hubhuman.rb myorgname > /path/to/www/humans.txt

Easy!

## Gem
I'll turn this script into a convenient gem just as soon as someone requests it and gives me a clever name for the gem. (Open a issue if you'd like this--issues without a clever name suggestion will be ignored!)
