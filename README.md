[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mroth/hubhumans.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mroth/hubhumans)

## Wut?

GitHub.com has a [shiny humans.txt](http://github.com/humans.txt) on their site which is [autogenerated from the organization team list](http://www.quora.com/GitHub/Does-GitHub-keep-its-complete-employee-list-in-the-sites-humans-txt-file/answer/Zach-Holman).  This is an nice way to keep the file up to date, so here's a quick hack to do so.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'hubhumans'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hubhumans

## Usage

Just pass the GitHub organization name. For example, the following commmand:

    hubhumans flickr

Would produce the following output:

    /* TEAM */

      Daniel Bogan (waferbaby)
      Site: http://usesthis.com/
      Location: San Francisco, California

      Eric Gelinas (standardpixel)
      Site: blog.standardpixel.com
      Location: San Francisco, California

      Stephen Woods (saw)
      Site: stephenwoods.net
      Location: 94110

    [...]

You may want to set up a cron task to periodically do the following to keep yours up to date:

    hubhumans myorgname > /path/to/www/humans.txt

Easy!
